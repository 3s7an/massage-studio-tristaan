                Massage is often regarded as an element of integrative medicine. It is given alongside conventional therapy for many medical illnesses and circumstances.

                Therapeutic massage increases muscle blood flow and warmth, boosts performance, reduces cell adhesion, increases muscular flexibility, and reduces injury risk.

                For thousands of years, therapeutic massage has been practiced throughout the globe. Researchers from the UK presented a study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, which shows that therapeutic massage accounts for roughly 45% of physiotherapy treatment time. Therapeutic massage is employed in broad ways, including competitive preparation, during contests, and post-competition recovery.
